## Project Title: PacMen-Exercise
## Description: 
PacMen on demand (button click) and move these pacmen across the page. This is a game where I created a "add pacman" and "start game" buttons on the DOM and when you click "add pacman" the game should add a new pacman and you then click on "start game" the new pacman should travel throughout the screen and when it hits a wall it bounces back to the opposite wall.
